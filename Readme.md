Mini Project
This mini project involves using Terraform and Ansible to deploy and configure infrastructure on AWS.

Objective
The main objectives of this project are:

Create 3 EC2 instances and place them behind an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) using Terraform.
Export the public IP addresses of the instances to a file called host-inventory after applying the Terraform plan.
Acquire a domain name (e.g., terraform-test.com.ng) and set it up with AWS Route53 within the Terraform plan.
Add an A record for the subdomain terraform-test pointing to the ELB IP address.
Use Ansible to install Apache, set the timezone to Africa/Lagos, and display a simple HTML page on all 3 EC2 instances.
Ensure that visiting terraform-test.yourdomain.com shows the content from the instances, rotating between the servers on each refresh.
Project Structure
The project includes the following components:

terraform/: Contains Terraform configuration files for infrastructure deployment.
ansible/: Includes Ansible playbook for configuring the EC2 instances.
host-inventory: A file generated by Terraform containing the public IP addresses of the instances.
Instructions
Follow these steps to complete the project:

Terraform Deployment
Navigate to the terraform/ directory.
Run terraform init to initialize the Terraform configuration.
Run terraform apply to create the EC2 instances and ELB.
After applying, Terraform will export the public IP addresses to host-inventory.

Terraform Deployment

Navigate to the terraform/ directory.
Run terraform init to initialize the Terraform configuration.
Run terraform apply to create the EC2 instances and ELB.
After applying, Terraform will export the public IP addresses to host-inventory.
AWS Route53 Configuration

Manually acquire a domain name (e.g., terraform-test.com.ng) and configure it with AWS Route53.
Add an A record for the subdomain terraform-test pointing to the ELB IP address obtained from the Terraform output.
Ansible Configuration

Navigate to the ansible/ directory.
Run the Ansible playbook to configure the EC2 instances:

ansible-playbook main.yml
